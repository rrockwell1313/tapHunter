#region Notes 7/13/23
/*
Left off on setting up the respawn of the projectile. Currently the projectile respawns in a non-position. So we need to set it away from the ammo manager 
and instead set it up in the scene. Define the current position on start of the projectil and then launch from there again instead of a parent area. This way
we can move the projectile to different areas like changing angles in the future.
